My name is Tom. I am 12 years old and I study at Happy Valley School in Hong Kong. Every day, I wake up at 7:00 in the morning. I have breakfast with my family at 7:30. My mother usually makes eggs and toast for me.

I go to school by MTR. It takes about 20 minutes. School starts at 8:30. My favourite subject is English because my teacher, Miss Wong, makes the lessons very interesting. I also like PE because I can play basketball with my friends.

After school, I go to the library to do my homework. I usually finish at 5:00 and then go home. In the evening, I watch TV and read books before going to bed at 10:00.
